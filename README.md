# Task #2 – Image Histogram Analysis

This repository contains my submission for *Task #2: Display Histogram* as part of the Image Processing assignment.

## Files Included

1. *Task_2_display_histogram (1).ipynb* – This notebook contains the full implementation code only, with clear structure and comments:
   - Grayscale histogram
   - RGB histograms
   - Brightness and contrast analysis

2. *Task_2_display_histogram.ipynb* – This notebook includes the *same code*, but also shows:
   - Image upload step
   - Output cells displaying the histograms
   - Proof that the code runs successfully with a real image

## Description

The project analyzes an image to compute and display:
- Grayscale histogram
- Red, Green, Blue channel histograms
- Brightness and contrast based on histogram data

## How to Use

1. Open Task_2_display_histogram.ipynb in Google Colab or any Jupyter-based environment.
2. Upload an image when prompted.
3. Run all cells to generate histograms and analysis results.

## Requirements

Make sure the following libraries are installed:
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- NumPy (numpy)
- Matplotlib (matplotlib)

## Notes

- The first file is a *clean version of the code*.
- The second file includes *proof of code execution*, with screenshots/output cells.
